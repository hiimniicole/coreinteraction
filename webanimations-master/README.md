# Web Animations with CSS 
## Core Interaction Lecture

This lecture focuses on using css instead of javascript to make animations. In this repo, you'll find the project files as well as a pdf with the lecture notes. NOTE: copy and pasting from a PDF does not work and leads to unkown characters that cause bugs that are very difficult to track.
